### Automatic Speech Recognition Feature Extraction Using OpenCL Improvements

Implemented using Intel OpenCL SDK and with no other prerequisites apart from libsndfile for wav file read.

P.S: Benchmarking features have been planned, at least against an existing pure CPU based implementation using FFTW library for CPU based FFT. For running that, it will obviously become a prerequisite. Until you specifically want to use it, I'm trying to keep it free from that pre requisite.

Links, methodology and details to be added soon
